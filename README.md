# Banker's Algorithm Simulator

This implementation of the Banker's algorithm is written in C#.The Banker's algorithm is a method used in operating systems to manage resources and prevent deadlocks by allowing processes to request and release resources in a safe and efficient way.


## How to use?

1)On the first page, locate and click on the "Start" button to initiate the program.

2)Upon clicking the start button, the program will redirect you to the second page. On this page, you will be required to enter the number of processes and resources needed for their execution.

3)After entering the number of processes and resources on the second page, click on the "Next" button to proceed to the third page. On this page, you will be prompted to select a specific process and provide detailed information regarding the required number and type of resources necessary for its execution. Additionally, you will be required to input the current allocation, maximum requirement, and available resources.

4)Before proceeding to the calculation stage, view the total resources available by clicking on the "View Total" button.

5)Once you have reviewed the total resources, proceed to initiate the evaluation process by clicking on the "Calculate" button.

6)You will be redirected to the fourth page, where the evaluation process will begin, and you will be presented with the results of each step by clicking on "Next Step" button indicating whether the requested resources can be granted or not.

7)Based on the evaluation results, you can determine whether the program is safe or not.
